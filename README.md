# Introduction to Create React App

This project is initialized using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Scripts You Can Use

Within the project directory, the following commands are available:

### `npm start`

This command runs your application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your app in the browser.

Any changes you make will trigger a reload of the page. You'll also be notified of any linting errors through the console.

### `npm test`

This initiates the test runner in a continuous interactive mode. More details on how to conduct tests can be found in the [testing guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Executes the build process for a production environment into the `build` folder. This process optimally bundles React for production and enhances the build for optimal performance.

The resulting build is minified, and the filenames are hashed. Your application is then set for deployment.

Consult the [deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for further information.

### `npm run eject`

**Important: 'eject' is irreversible. Once done, there's no going back!**

If the preset build tools and configurations do not meet your needs, you can use `eject` at any point. This will remove the sole build dependency and directly integrate configuration files and dependencies (like webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project for complete control.

Post-ejection, all commands will operate, but they will target the newly integrated scripts, allowing you to modify them as needed. This puts you in charge of your setup.

Itâ€™s not mandatory to use `eject`; the preset configuration is intended for both small and medium-sized deployments. This feature is provided with the understanding that it may be necessary for those who wish to make modifications once they are ready.
